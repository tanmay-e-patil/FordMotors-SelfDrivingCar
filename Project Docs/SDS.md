# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose of this document

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the implementation of the project called `Volante`.

The goal of this project is to make an autonomous self-driving car, capable of maneuvering around bends, avoiding obstacles and following traffic signals and road signs.

The tools used in this project and described in this document are:

* TensorFlow library for machine learning
* Vision API by Google Cloud Platform and TensorFlow.

The hardware used in this project and described in this document are:

* RC Car serving as the actual self-driving car
* Arduino Uno used for controlling the car speed and turning radius
* Ultrasonic sensors to detect objects in front of the car
* Raspberry Pi used for capturing and transmission of camera data and communicating with Google Cloud Platform
* Android device used for collecting camera, GPS and compass information.

## 1.2 Scope of the development project

Road safety has been an issue for as long as cars have been in existence. Over *1.3* million people die of road accidents every year across the globe, most of which are preventable. Ever-rising road traffic has led to an exponential increase in commute time. This has a direct impact not only on people's productivity but also on the environment.

Recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence along with the ever-increasing performance of modern day computers have enabled the use of these technologies in developing self-driving cars. These cars have several advantages, as described below:

* Better road safety: Machines are not prone to human-error and distractions, leading to swift and appropriate responses in real-time road conditions.
* Reduced commute time: With cars communicating with each other and using modern GPS systems, commute times can be greatly reduced as self-driving cars reduce the *"phantom effect"* in modern-day traffic.
* Increased productivity: Reduced commute times mean more time can be spent on what matters more.
* Reduced expenditure: Reduction in accidents will directly lead to reduced expenditure on damages.
* Environment-friendly: Efficient driving styles of the self-driving car will lead to lower emissions.
* Solution to parking problem: Most of the modern cities face parking problems and which can be resolved by this solution.
* Better traffic discipline: Better law enforcement can be achieved and traffic can be managed by capping speed in various regions.
* Potential for a new design: Because a vehicle may eventually function as a self-guided train car, the potential for new car designs is huge. With no need for complicated driving tools, self-driving cars could include new ways to relax or to stay entertained.

# 2. Conceptual Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](../Images/architecture-diagram.jpg?raw=true)

## 2.1 Overview of modules and components

1. Android Device

    * **Camera:** The camera module is responsible for capturing what is right in front of the car. This camera data is processed by the machine learning algorithm to judge the car's environment.

    * **GPS:** The GPS module is used to capture the car's current location and help it navigate through the location points provided by Google Places API.

    * **Compass:** The compass module provides the car's current heading direction and helps correct car's direction of motion.

2. Arduino UNO Rev. 3

    * **GPIO Driver:** This software driver is responsible for parallel communication with Raspberry Pi. It is used for receiving speed and turn data from Raspberry Pi, and for running the motors at desired speed and direction.

    * **Motor Driver:** This software driver is responsible for running the car's motors at the desired speed and direction. It also controls the car's degree and direction of turn.

3. Car

    * **DC Motor:** These motors are responsible for actually running the car.

4. Cloud Platform

    * **Machine Learning Algorithm:** The machine learning algorithm is at the heart of this project. The model processes visual data from the Android device to judge the car's environment. This judgement is used by the Raspberry Pi to control the car's motion.

    * **Storage:** Apart from the actual machine learning algorithm, the cloud platform also provides with a big and reliable storage space for storing all the training and testing data for the algorithm. It is also used for storing location and heading information from the Android device.

5. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

     * **Car Driver:** This software module is responsible for actually running the car via Arduino. It takes classification and correction data from GCP and sends required signals to the Arduino to drive the car.

     * **Cloud API:** This API is used by the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the cloud platform.

     * **GPIO Driver:** This software driver is responsible for parallel communication with Arduino. It is used for sending speed and turn data to the Arduino, which then actuates the car's motors.

# 4.0 Reuse and relationships to their products <a name="rartop"></a>

This project is not doing any enhancement work for existing Softwares but we via this project have developed a complete new approach of doing enhancement to existing concept of a Self Driving Car, which performs various actions. In addition to that,the project completely focusses over developing a model based on Cloud Platform and perform all its functions remotely keeping in mind the extensive cost expenditures at scale.
So, the enhancement in this project offers an approach to build Self Driving cars with minimal usage of *On-Board* hardware and connects various platform technologies like Android, Cloud and Microcontrollers to a distributed processing unit system which functions to offer all the capabilities which have been developed and offered by presently available options like Waymo: Google Self driving Car Project, Bosch Self Driving Car Project and many other. Enhancements like Mobile Vision and Labeling have been kept under further additions to this project as the present platforms in use for the project don't offer complete support and are labelled under experimental.

PS: Infrastructure and cost optimisations are to be looked at while comparing the features and quality with present day contenders.
