This Software Requirement Specification also includes:

* Overall description of the product
* External interface requirements
* System Features
* Other nonfunctional requirements

## 1.4 Product Scope

Road safety has been an issue for as long as cars have been in existence. Over *1.3* million people die of road accidents every year across the globe, most of which are preventable. Ever-rising road traffic has led to an exponential increase in commute time. This has a direct impact not only on people's productivity but also on the environment.

Recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence along with the ever-increasing performance of modern day computers have enabled the use of these technologies in developing self-driving cars. These cars have several advantages, as described below:

* Better road safety: Machines are not prone to human-error and distractions, leading to swift and appropriate responses in real-time road conditions.
* Reduced commute time: With cars communicating with each other and using modern GPS systems, commute times can be greatly reduced as self-driving cars reduce the *"phantom effect"* in modern-day traffic.
* Increased productivity: Reduced commute times mean more time can be spent on what matters more.
* Reduced expenditure: Reduction in accidents will directly lead to reduced expenditure on damages.
* Environment-friendly: Efficient driving styles of the self-driving car will lead to lower emissions.
* Solution to parking problem: Most of the modern cities face parking problems and which can be resolved by this solution.
* Better traffic discipline: Better law enforcement can be achieved and traffic can be managed by capping speed in various regions.
* Potential for a new design: Because a vehicle may eventually function as a self-guided train car, the potential for new car designs is huge. With no need for complicated driving tools, self-driving cars could include new ways to relax or to stay entertained.

# 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 Product Perspective

This system consists of following components:

* RC Car: analogous to real-world car and tries to mimic it
* Machine Learning Model: makes decisions as to how the car should move
* Arduino and Raspberry Pi: along with motors, form the car’s underlying hardware
* PiCam: collects visual data
* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC - SR04): collects distance data

**RC Car** acts as an analog to the real world car with basic motion capabilities. It is battery operated.

The **Machine Learning Model** guides the car in the environment based on the data set on which it is trained. The model uses neural networks as the underlying learning framework.

**Arduino Uno** controls the actual car’s hardware. It runs the car’s motors and collects distance from the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. This data is then sent to the Raspberry Pi for processing.

**Raspberry Pi** act as interfaces between the Arduino and GCP. While Arduino controls the motion of the car itself,Pi performs the driving descisions transferring it from GCP server after classification to Arduino

**Android** acts as a data collector program using cloud storage capabilities to store data in the form of images fro classification.

# 3. External Interface Requirements

## 3.1 User Interfaces

Since this an autonomous self-driving car, the user does not directly interact with the car. Rather, the car may have some in-dash computer system, like those found in modern day cars.

The in-dash systems, apart from providing entertainment features and vital information like speed and engine RPM, provide navigation aids like GPS as well. They, thus, act as an interface between the user and the car. Such in-dash systems and modifications required for them to work with our system, however, are beyond the scope of this project.

## 3.2 Hardware Interfaces

* The deep neural network, running on the Google Cloud Platform, will communicate with the car using a Raspberry Pi 3. The embedded software in Raspberry Pi will itself communicate with the car using an Arduino Uno. The Arduino Uno will run the car by generating PWM signals sent to an L293D IC to run the motors.

* The Raspberry Pi Camera Module connects onto the Raspberry Pi via a non-standard parallel interface.

* The ultrasonic distance sensor communicates with Arduino using a regular GPIO interface.

## 3.3 Software Interfaces

   1. Camera input using a built-in library in Raspbian OS
   2. Speed and turn data output to the Arduino using RPi.GPIO library
   3. Communication with the cloud platform via WiFi using a built-in library in Raspbian OS.

* The embedded software system on the Arduino Uno has the following interfaces:

   1. Direction and speed data input using built-in Arduino libraries
   2. PWM output to motors using built-in Arduino libraries

## 3.4 Communication Interfaces

* The Raspberry Pi will communicate with the Google Cloud Platform over Wifi (IEEE Standard 802.11), using an HTTPS protocol.

* The communication interface between Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno is a non-standard GPIO interface.

* The communication interface between Arduino Uno and the car motors is a non-standard PWM interface.

## 4.4 Scenario: Encounter inactive traffic signal

### 4.4.1 Description

The car encounters an inactive traffic signal right in front of it on the road. The car decreases its speed but continues its motion. The car continues to move at this speed until it has passed the traffic signal, then accelerates and continues its motion with original speed, depending on the environment and the stimulus received.

### 4.4.2 Functional Response

The computer vision data received post-processing results in alerting the Raspberry Pi of the presence of an inactive traffic signal. The Raspberry Pi instructs the Arduino to decrease the car's speed. The Raspberry Pi makes the car to move in the decreased speed until it crosses the traffic signal.

The Raspberry Pi instructs the Arduino to halt the car's motion. The car remains stationary so long as the obstacle is present. Once cleared, the Raspberry Pi instructs the Arduino to accelerate and waits for the next stimulus.

## 4.13 Scenario: Sudden appearance of an object in front of the car (Case of Emergency Braking)

### 4.13.1 Description

This scenario is very similar to 4.12, with the difference that the object suddenly pops in front of the car, without any warning whatsoever. The car attempts an immediate halt. Reverse motion may be applied, if necessary. Until the obstacle is cleared, the car remains stationary, post which it resumes normal operation.

### 4.13.2 Functional Response

The computer vision data received, along with the data from the distance sensor, alerts the Raspberry Pi of the sudden appearance of an object in front of the car. The Raspberry Pi instructs the Arduino to immediately halt the car's motion, applying reversing motion, if necessary. The car remains stationary so long as the obstacle is present. Once cleared, the Raspberry Pi instructs the Arduino to accelerate and waits for the next stimulus.
